## [‚Äã](#1-image-generation-model-overview) 1.Image generation model overview

The platform provides image generation models that can be used in two main ways: generating images directly based on prompts, or generating image variants based on existing images.

* Generating images based on text prompts
  When using large text-to-image models, carefully designed prompts (instructions) can help generate higher quality images. Here are some tips to improve the quality of generated images:
  + Specific description: Try to describe the image content in detail. For example, if you want to generate a sunset beach scene, instead of just ‚Äúbeach sunset,‚Äù you can try ‚Äúa serene beach with the sun setting, the sky turning orange and red, gentle waves lapping at the sand, and a small boat in the distance.‚Äù
  + Emotion and atmosphere: Besides describing the content, you can also add descriptions of emotions or atmosphere, such as ‚Äúcozy,‚Äù ‚Äúmysterious,‚Äù or ‚Äúenergetic,‚Äù which can help the model better understand the desired style.
  + Style specification: If you have a specific art style preference, such as ‚Äúimpressionist‚Äù or ‚Äúsurrealism,‚Äù you can specify it in the prompt to make the generated image more likely to meet your expectations.
  + Avoid vague words: Try to avoid using abstract or vague words, such as ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù or ‚Äúgood,‚Äù as these words are difficult for the model to concretize and may result in images that differ significantly from your expectations.
  + Use negatives: If you do not want certain elements in the image, you can use negative words to exclude them. For example, ‚Äúgenerate a beach sunset image without a boat.‚Äù
  + Step-by-step input: For complex scenes, you can try inputting the prompt in steps, first generating a basic image and then adjusting or adding details as needed.
  + Try different descriptions: Sometimes, even if you describe the same scene, different descriptions can yield different results. Try describing the scene from different angles or using different words to see which one gives you the best result.
  + Utilize model-pecific features: Some models may offer specific features or parameter adjustment options, such as adjusting the resolution or style strength of the generated image. Properly utilizing these features can also help improve the quality of the generated image.

By using these methods, you can effectively improve the quality of images generated using large text-to-image models. However, since different models may have different characteristics and preferences, you may need to make appropriate adjustments based on the specific model‚Äôs features and feedback.
You can refer to the following examples:
> A futuristic eco-friendly skyscraper in central Tokyo. The building incorporates lush vertical gardens on every floor, with cascading plants and trees lining glass terraces. Solar panels and wind turbines are integrated into the structure‚Äôs design, reflecting a sustainable future. The Tokyo Tower is visible in the background, contrasting the modern eco-architecture with traditional city landmarks.

> An elegant snow leopard perched on a cliff in the Himalayan mountains, surrounded by swirling snow. The animal‚Äôs fur is intricately detailed with distinctive patterns and a thick winter coat. The scene captures the majesty and isolation of the leopard‚Äôs habitat, with mist and mountain peaks fading into the background.

* Generating image variants based on existing images
  Some image generation models support generating image variants based on existing images. In this case, you still need to input appropriate prompts to achieve the desired results. You can refer to the above content for prompt input.

## [‚Äã](#2-experience-address) 2.Experience address

You can experience the [image generation](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/playground/image) function by visiting Image Generation or by referring to the API documentation to call the API.

* Key parameters introduction
  + image\_size: Controls the image resolution. You can customize various resolutions when making API requests.
  + num\_inference\_steps: Controls the number of steps in image generation. Some models can generate better results by adjusting the step length. Models like black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell, Pro/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell, and stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-5-large-turbo do not support adjusting the step length and use a default step length of 4.
  + batch\_size: The number of images generated at once. The default value is 1, with a maximum value of 4.
  + negative\_prompt: Here, you can input elements that you do not want to appear in the image to eliminate some influencing factors.
  + seed: If you want to generate the same image every time, you can set the seed to a fixed value.

## [‚Äã](#3-supported-models-list) 3.Supported models list

Currently supported image generation models:

* Kwai-Kolors/Kolors

Note: The supported image generation models may be subject to change. Please filter by the ‚ÄúImage‚Äù tag on the Models to obtain the current list of supported models.

## [‚Äã](#3-usage-recommendations) 3. Usage recommendations

### [‚Äã](#3-1-api-parameters) 3.1 API parameters

#### [‚Äã](#3-1-1-input-parameters) 3.1.1 Input parameters

* Input parameters:
  + Maximum Chain-of-Thought Length (thinking\_budget): The number of tokens the model uses for internal reasoning. Adjusting the thinking\_budget controls the length of the chain-of-thought process.
  + Maximum Response Length (max\_tokens): This is used to limit the number of tokens in the final output to the user, excluding the chain-of-thought part. Users can configure this normally to control the maximum length of the response.

Maximum Context Length (context\_length): This is the maximum total content length, including the user input, chain-of-thought, and output. It is not a request parameter and does not need to be set by the user.
The maximum response length, maximum reasoning chain length, and maximum context length supported by different models are shown in the table below:

| Model | Maximum Response Length | Maximum Reasoning Chain Length | Maximum Context Length |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DeepSeek-R1 | 16384 | 65536 | 163840 |
| DeepSeek-R1-Distill Series | 16384 | 32768 | 131072 |
| Qwen3 Series | 8192 | 32768 | 131072 |
| QwQ-32B | 32768 | 16384 | 131072 |
| GLM-Z1 Series | 16384 | 32768 | 131072 |
| MiniMax-M1-80k | 40000 | 40000 | 80000 |
| Hunyuan-A13B-Instruct | 8192 | 38912 | 131072 |
| GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking | 16384 | 32768 | 65536 |
| ascend-tribe/pangu-pro-moe | 8192 | 38912 | 131072 |

* After decoupling the reasoning model‚Äôs chain-of-thought process from the response length, the output behavior will follow the following rules:
  + If the number of tokens generated during the ‚Äúthinking phase‚Äù reaches the thinking\_budget, the Qwen3 series reasoning model, which natively supports this parameter, will forcibly stop the chain-of-thought reasoning. Other reasoning models might continue to output the thinking content.
  + If the maximum response length exceeds the max\_tokens limit or the context length exceeds the context\_length restriction, the response content will be truncated. The finish\_reason field in the response will be marked as length, indicating that the output was terminated due to length constraints.

#### [‚Äã](#3-1-2-return-parameters) 3.1.2 Return parameters

* Return parameters:
  + reasoning\_contentÔºöReasoning chain content, at the same level as content.
  + contentÔºöFinal answer content

### [‚Äã](#3-2-deepseek-r1-usage-recommendations) 3.2 DeepSeek-R1 Usage Recommendations

* Set the temperature within the range of 0.5-0.7 (0.6 is recommended) to prevent endless repetitions or incoherent outputs.
* Set the value of top\_p to 0.95.
* Avoid adding a system prompt; all instructions should be contained within the user prompt
* For mathematical problems, it is advisable to include a directive in your prompt such as: ‚ÄúPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed.‚Äù
* When evaluating model performance, it is recommended to conduct multiple tests and average the results.

### [‚Äã](#2-2-message-body-structure-description) 2.2 Message Body Structure Description

| Message Type | Description | Example Content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| system | Model instruction, sets the AI role and describes how the model should generally behave and respond | Example: ‚ÄúYou are a pediatrician with 10 years of experience‚Äù |
| user | User input, passes the final user‚Äôs message to the model | Example: ‚ÄúHow should I handle a child with persistent low fever?‚Äú |
| assistant | Model-generated historical responses, provides examples for the model to understand how it should respond to the current request | Example: ‚ÄúI would suggest first taking the child‚Äôs temperature‚Ä¶‚Äù |

When you want the model to follow layered instructions, message roles can help you get better outputs. However, they are not deterministic, so the best approach is to try different methods and see which one gives you the desired results.

## [‚Äã](#3-model-series-selection-guide) 3. Model Series Selection Guide

You can enter the [Models](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/models) and filter language models that support different functionalities using the filters on the left. Based on the model descriptions, you can understand the specific pricing, model parameter size, maximum context length supported by the model, and other details.
You can experience the models in the [playground](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/playground/chat) (the playground only provides model experience and does not have a history record function. If you want to save the conversation records, please save the session content yourself).

**1. Model Output Encoding Issues**
Currently, some models are prone to encoding issues when parameters are not set. If you encounter such issues, you can try setting the temperature, top\_k, top\_p, and frequency\_penalty parameters.
Modify the payload as follows, adjusting as needed for different languages:

Copy

```
    payload = {
        "model": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct",
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "1+1=?",
            }
        ],
        "max_tokens": 200,  # Adjust as needed
        "temperature": 0.7, # Adjust as needed
        "top_k": 50,        # Adjust as needed
        "top_p": 0.7,       # Adjust as needed
        "frequency_penalty": 0 # Adjust as needed
    }

```

**2. Explanation of max\_tokens**
For the LLM models provided by the platform:

* The model with a max\_tokens limit of `16384`:

  + THUDM/GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking
  + Pro/THUDM/GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking
* The model with a max\_tokens limit of `8192`:
  + baidu/ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B
  + tencent/Hunyuan-A13B-Instruct
  + Tongyi-Zhiwen/QwenLong-L1-32B
  + Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B

  + deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3
  + Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct
  + ascend-tribe/pangu-pro-moe
* The model with a max\_tokens limit of `4096`:
  + Other LLM models aside from those mentioned above

**3. Explanation of context\_length**
The context\_length varies for different LLM models. You can search for the specific model on the [Models](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/models) to view the model details.
**4. Output Truncation Issues in Model Inference**
Here are several aspects to troubleshoot the issue:

* When encountering output truncation through API requests:
  + Max Tokens Setting: Set the max\_token to an appropriate value. If the output exceeds the max\_token, it will be truncated. For the deepseek R1 series, the max\_token can be set up to 16,384.
  + Stream Request Setting: In non-stream requests, long output content is prone to 504 timeout issues.
  + Client Timeout Setting: Increase the client timeout to prevent truncation before the output is fully completed.
* When encountering output truncation through third-party client requests:
  + CherryStdio has a default max\_tokens of 4,096. Users can enable the ‚ÄúEnable Message Length Limit‚Äù switch to set the max\_token to an appropriate value.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/siliconflow-37161621/images/faqs/mic/image_5.png)

**5. Error Code Handling**

| Error Code | Common Cause | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | Incorrect parameter format | Check the value range of parameters like temperature. |
| 401 | API Key not correctly set | Check the API Key. |
| 403 | Insufficient permissions | The most common reason is that the model requires real-name authentication. Refer to the error message for other cases. |
| 429 | Exceeded request frequency limit | Implement exponential backoff retry mechanism. |
| 503/504 | Model overload | Switch to a backup model node. |

## [√¢‚Ç¨‚Äπ](#1-use-cases) 1. Use cases

Video generation models are technologies that use text or image descriptions to generate dynamic video content. As the technology continues to advance, its applications are becoming increasingly widespread. Some potential application areas include:

1. Dynamic content generation: Video generation models can create dynamic visual content to describe and explain information.
2. Multimodal intelligent interaction: Combining image and text inputs, video generation models can be used for more intelligent and interactive applications.
3. Replacing or enhancing traditional visual technologies: Video generation models can replace or enhance traditional machine vision technologies to solve more complex multimodal problems. As technology progresses, the multimodal capabilities of video generation models will integrate with visual language models, driving their comprehensive application in intelligent interaction, automated content generation, and complex scenario simulation. Additionally, video generation models can be combined with image generation models (image-to-video) to further expand their application range, achieving more diverse and rich visual content generation.

## [√¢‚Ç¨‚Äπ](#2-usage-ecommendations) 2. Usage ecommendations

When writing prompts, pay attention to detailed, chronological descriptions of actions and scenes. Include specific actions, appearance, camera angles, and environmental details. All content should be written in a single paragraph, starting directly with the main action, and the description should be specific and precise. Imagine yourself as a director describing a shot script. Keep the prompt within 200 words.
To achieve the best results, structure your prompt as follows:

* Start with a sentence describing the main action
  + Example√Ø¬º≈°A woman with light skin, wearing a blue jacket and a black hat with a veil,She first looks down and to her right, then raises her head back up as she speaks.
* Add specific details about actions and gestures
  + Example√Ø¬º≈°She first looks down and to her right, then raises her head back up as she speaks.
* Precisely describe the appearance of the character/object
  + Example√Ø¬º≈°She has brown hair styled in an updo, light brown eyebrows, and is wearing a white collared shirt under her blue jacket.
* Include details about the background and environment
  + Example√Ø¬º≈°The background is out of focus, but shows trees and people in period clothing.
* Specify the camera angle and movement
  + Example√Ø¬º≈°The camera remains stationary on her face as she speaks.
* Describe lighting and color effects
  + Example√Ø¬º≈°The scene is captured in real-life footage, with natural lighting and true-to-life colors.
* Note any changes or sudden events
  + Example√Ø¬º≈°A gust of wind blows through the trees, causing the woman√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s veil to flutter slightly.

Example of a video generated from the above prompt:
[Your browser does not support the video tag.](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/siliconflow-37161621/en/userguide/capabilities/example.mp4)

`tencent/HunyuanVideo-HD` not supports [API calls](https://docs.siliconflow.cn/api-reference/videos/videos_submit).

2. Image-to-Video Resolution
   The resolution is automatically matched based on the aspect ratio of the user√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s uploaded image:

* 16:9 ƒü≈∏‚Äò‚Ä∞ 1280√É‚Äî720
* 9:16 ƒü≈∏‚Äò‚Ä∞ 720√É‚Äî1280
* 1:1 ƒü≈∏‚Äò‚Ä∞ 960√É‚Äî960

For optimal generation results, we recommend using images with aspect ratios of 16:9 / 9:16 / 1:1 to generate videos.

Note: The supported text-to-video models may be subject to change. Please filter by the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìVideo√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ tag on the Models to obtain the current list of supported models.

## [‚Äã](#1-use-cases) 1. Use cases

Vision-Language Models (VLM) are large language models that can accept both visual (image) and linguistic (text) inputs. Based on VLM, you can input image and text information, and the model can understand both the image and the context information and respond accordingly. For example:

1. Visual Content Interpretation: Require the model to interpret and describe the information in the image, such as objects, text, spatial relationships, colors, and atmosphere in the image;
2. Conduct multi-round conversations combining visual content and context;
3. Partially replace traditional machine vision models like OCR;
4. With the continuous improvement of model capabilities, future applications can include visual intelligent agents and robots.

## [‚Äã](#2-usage) 2. Usage

For VLM models, you can construct a message content containing image URL or base64 encoded image when calling the /chat/completions interface. Use the detail parameter to control the preprocessing of the image.

### [‚Äã](#2-1-description-of-image-detail-control-parameters) 2.1 Description of image detail control parameters

SiliconCloud provides three detail parameter options: `low`, `high`, and `auto`. For currently supported models, if detail is not specified or set to `high`, the `high` (high-resolution) mode will be used. If detail is set to `low` or `auto`, the `low` (low-resolution) mode will be used.

### [‚Äã](#2-2-example-format-of-message-containing-an-image) 2.2 Example format of message containing an image

For InternVL series models:
It is recommended to `{ "type":"text", "text":"text-prompt here" }` place after the image in the request body to achieve the best results.

## [‚Äã](#4-billing-for-visual-input-content) 4. Billing for visual input content

For visual input content such as images, the models will convert them into tokens, which will be included in the model output context and billed accordingly. The conversion methods vary for different models. Below are the current conversion methods for supported models.

### [‚Äã](#4-1-qwen-series) 4.1 Qwen series

Rules:
`Qwen` supports a maximum resolution of `3584 * 3584 = 12845056` and a minimum resolution of `56 * 56 = 3136`. The dimensions of each image will be resized to multiples of `28`, `specifically (h * 28) * (w * 28)`. If the resolution is not within the minimum and maximum pixel range, it will be proportionally resized to that range.

1. When `detail=low`, all images will be resized to `448 * 448` pixels, corresponding to `256 tokens`;
2. When `detail=high`, the resolution will be proportionally resized. First, the width and height will be rounded up to the nearest multiple of `28`, then proportionally resized to the pixel range `(3136, 12845056)`, ensuring that both the width and height are multiples of `28`.

Examples:

* Images with dimensions `224 * 448`, `1024 * 1024`, and `3172 * 4096`, when `detail=low` is selected, will consume `256 tokens`each;
* An image with dimensions `224 * 448`, when `detail=high` is selected, because `224 * 448` is within the pixel range and both width and height are multiples of `28`, it will consume `(224/28) * (448/28) = 8 * 16 = 128 tokens`;
* An image with dimensions `1024 * 1024`, when detail=high is selected, will be rounded up to the nearest multiple of `28` to `1036 * 1036`, which is within the pixel range, consuming `(1036/28) * (1036/28) = 1369 tokens`;
* An image with dimensions `3172 * 4096`, when `detail=high` is selected, will be rounded up to the nearest multiple of `28` to `3192 * 4116`, which exceeds the maximum pixel limit. It will then be proportionally resized to `3136 * 4060`, consuming `(3136/28) * (4060/28) = 16240 tokens`.

### [‚Äã](#4-2-deepseekvl2-series) 4.2 DeepseekVL2 series

Rules:
`DeepseekVL2` processes each image into two parts: global\_view and local\_view. global\_view resizes the original image to `384*384`pixels, while local\_view divides the image into multiple `384*384` blocks. Additional tokens are added to connect the blocks based on the width.

1. When `detail=low`, all images will be resized to `384*384` pixels.
2. When `detail=high`, the images will be resized to dimensions that are multiples of `384(OpenAI uses 512)`, `(h*384) * (w * 384)`, and `1 <= h*w <= 9`.

* The scaling dimensions `h * w` will be chosen according to the following rules:
  + Both `h` and `w` are integers, and within the constraint `1 <= h*w <= 9`, traverse the combinations of `(h, w)`.
  + Resize the image to `(h*384, w*384)` pixels and compare with the original image‚Äôs pixels. Take the minimum value between the new image‚Äôs pixels and the original image‚Äôs pixels as the effective pixel value. Take the difference between the original image‚Äôs pixels and the effective pixel value as the invalid pixel value. If the effective pixel value exceeds the previously determined effective pixel value, or if the effective pixel value is the same but the invalid pixel value is smaller, choose the current `(h*384, w*384)` combination.
  + Token consumption will follow the following rules:
    - `(h*w + 1) * 196 + (w+1) * 14 + 1 token`

Examples:

* Images with dimensions `224 x 448`, `1024 x 1024`, and `2048 x 4096`, when `detail=low` is selected, will consume `421 tokens` each.
* An image with dimensions `384 x 768`, when `detail=high` is selected, has an aspect ratio of `1:1` and will be resized to `384 x 768`. At this point, `h=1, w=2`, consuming `(1*2 + 1) * 196 + (2+1) * 14 + 1 = 631 tokens`.
* An image with dimensions `1024 x 1024`, when `detail=high` is selected, will be resized to `1152*1152(h=w=3)`, consuming `(3*3 + 1) * 196 + (3+1) * 14 + 1 = 2017 tokens`.
* An image with dimensions `2048 x 4096`, when `detail=high` is selected, has an aspect ratio of `1:2` and will be resized to `768*1536(h=2, w=4)`, `consuming (2*4 + 1) * 196 + (4+1) * 14 + 1 = 1835 tokens`.

### [‚Äã](#4-3-glm-4-1v-9b-thinking) 4.3 GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking

Rules:
`GLM-4.1V` supports a minimum pixel size of `28 * 28`, scaling image dimensions proportionally to the nearest integer multiple of `28` pixels.
If the scaled pixel size is smaller than `112 * 112` or larger than `4816894`, adjust the dimensions proportionally to fit within the range while maintaining multiples of `28`.

1. `detail=low`: Resize all images to `448*448` pixels, resulting in `256 tokens`.
2. `detail=high`: Scale proportionally by first rounding the dimensions to the nearest `28-pixel` multiple, then adjusting to fit within the pixel range `(12544, 4816894)`while ensuring both dimensions remain multiples of `28`.

Examples:

* `224 x 448`, `1024 x 1024`, `3172 x 4096`: With `detail=low`, all consume `256 tokens`.
* `224 x 448`: With `detail=high`, since dimensions are within range and multiples of `28`, `tokens = (224//28) * (448//28) = 8 * 16 = 128 tokens`.
* `1024 x 1024`: With detail=high, dimensions are rounded to `1036*1036` (within range), `tokens = (1036//28) * (1036//28) = 1369 tokens`.
* `3172 x 4096`: With detail=high, rounded to `3192 x 4088` (exceeds maximum), then scaled proportionally to `1932 x 2464`, `tokens = (1932//28) * (2464//28) = 6072 tokens`.

## [‚Äã](#1-introduction-to-fine-tuning) 1. Introduction to Fine-tuning

Model fine-tuning is a technique that involves further training an existing pre-trained model using a specific task dataset. This allows the model to retain its general knowledge learned from large datasets while adapting to the nuances of specific tasks. The benefits of using fine-tuned models include:

* Improved Performance: Fine-tuning can significantly enhance a model‚Äôs performance on specific tasks.
* Reduced Training Time: Fine-tuning typically requires less training time and computational resources compared to training from scratch.
* Adaptation to Specific Domains: Fine-tuning helps models better adapt to data and tasks specific to certain domains.

SiliconCloud platform provides efficient model fine-tuning capabilities. Currently, the following models support fine-tuning:

* Chat Models:
  + Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct
  + Qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct
  + Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct
  + Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct

For the latest supported models, refer to [Model Fine-Tuning](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/fine-tune).

#### [‚Äã](#2-1-1-data-preparation-for-language-models) 2.1.1 Data Preparation for Language Models

Only `.jsonl` files are supported, and they must meet the following requirements:

1. Each line is an independent JSON object.
2. Each object must contain an array with the key messages, and the array must not be empty.
3. Each element in the messages array must contain role and content fields.
4. role can only be system, user, or assistant.
5. If there are system role messages, they must be at the beginning of the array.
6. The first non-system message must be from the user role.
7. user and assistant role messages should alternate and appear in pairs, with at least one pair.

Example of data:

## [‚Äã](#1-use-cases) 1. Use Cases

The Function Calling feature enables the model to call external tools to enhance its capabilities. This capability can leverage external tools through the large model, such as searching for external knowledge, checking itineraries, or using specific domain tools, effectively addressing issues like hallucination and Knowledge Timeliness.

## [‚Äã](#2-usage) 2. Usage

### [‚Äã](#2-1-adding-tools-request-parameters-via-rest-api) 2.1 Adding tools Request Parameters via REST API

## [‚Äã](#1-use-cases) 1. Use Cases

Currently, the SiliconCloud large model API platform defaults to generating unstructured text. However, in certain use cases, you may want the model to output content in a structured format. However, instructing the large model directly with prompts may not yield the correct structured output.
As a standardized and lightweight data exchange format, the JSON schema is an important feature that supports the large model API to produce structured outputs. When you call the large model‚Äôs API to make a request, the model returns results in JSON format, which is easy for humans to read and write, and also easy for machines to parse and generate.
Now, all major language models on the SiliconCloud platform, except for the R1 series and V3 models from DeepSeek, support JSON mode, allowing the model to output JSON-formatted strings to ensure that the model outputs in the expected structure, making it easier to logically parse the output content.
For example, you can now try structured output using the SiliconCloud API for the following cases:

* Building a news database from company-related reports, including news titles and links.
* Extracting sentiment analysis structures from product purchase reviews, including sentiment polarity (positive, negative, neutral), sentiment intensity, and sentiment keywords.
* Extracting product lists from purchase history, including product information, recommendation reasons, prices, and promotional information.

## [‚Äã](#2-usage) 2. Usage

Add in the request:

Copy

```
response_format={"type": "json_object"}

```

## [‚Äã](#3-supported-model-list) 3. Supported Model List

Currently, all large language models support the aforementioned parameters.

Note: The supported models may change, please refer to this document for the latest list of supported models.

Your application must detect and handle edge cases that may result in incomplete JSON objects from the model output.

Please set max\_tokens reasonably to prevent JSON strings from being interrupted.

## [‚Äã](#4-usage-examples) 4. Usage Examples

Below is an example using OpenAIÔºö

Copy

```
import json  
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="ÊÇ®ÁöÑ APIKEY", # ‰ªéhttps://cloud.siliconflow.cn/account/akËé∑Âèñ
    base_url="https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V2.5",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant designed to output JSON."},
            {"role": "user", "content": "? 2020 Âπ¥‰∏ñÁïåÂ••Ëøê‰ºö‰πí‰πìÁêÉÁî∑Â≠êÂíåÂ•≥Â≠êÂçïÊâìÂÜ†ÂÜõÂàÜÂà´ÊòØË∞Å? "

        ],
        response_format={"type": "json_object"}
    )

print(response.choices[0].message.content)

```

The model will outputÔºö

## [‚Äã](#1-rate-limits-overview) 1. Rate limits overview

### [‚Äã](#1-1-what-are-rate-limits) 1.1 What are rate limits

Rate limits refer to the rules governing the frequency of API requests a user can make to the SiliconCloud platform services within a specified time period.

### [‚Äã](#1-2-why-implement-rate-limits) 1.2 Why implement rate limits

Rate limits are a common practice for APIs, and the reasons for implementing them include:

* Ensuring Fair and Efficient Resource Use: Ensuring that resources are used fairly. Preventing some users from making too many requests, which could affect the normal usage experience of other users.
* Avoiding Overload: Enhancing service reliability. Helps manage overall platform load to avoid performance issues due to sudden increases in requests.
* Security Protection: Preventing malicious attacks that could overload the platform and cause service interruptions.

### [‚Äã](#1-3-rate-limits-metrics) 1.3 Rate limits metrics

Currently, rate limits are measured by four metrics:

* RPM (requests per minute, the maximum number of requests that can be initiated per minute)
* RPH (requests per hour, the maximum number of requests allowed per hour)
* RPD (Requests per day, daily maximum number of requests allowed)
* TPM (tokens per minute, the maximum number of tokens allowed per minute)
* TPD (Tokens per day, daily maximum number of tokens allowed)
* IPM (images per minute, the maximum number of images generated per minute)
* IPD (images per day, the maximum number of images generated per day)

### [‚Äã](#1-4-rate-limits-metrics-for-different-models) 1.4 Rate limits metrics for different models

| Model name | Rate limits metrics | Current metrics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Language model (Chat) | RPM„ÄÅ TPM | RPM=1000-10000 TPM=50000-5000000 |
| Vector model (embedding) | RPM„ÄÅ TPM | RPM:2000-10000 TPM:500000-10000000 |
| Re-ranking model (reranker) | RPM„ÄÅ TPM | RPM:2000 TPM:500000 |
| Image generation model (image) | IPM„ÄÅIPD | IPM:2- IPD:400- |
| Multimodal model (multimodal models) | - | - |

Rate limits may trigger based on whichever metric (RPM„ÄÅRPH„ÄÅRPD„ÄÅTPM„ÄÅTPD„ÄÅIPM„ÄÅIPD) reaches its peak first.
For example, with an RPM limit of 20 and a TPM limit of 200K, if an account sends 20 requests to ChatCompletions in a minute, each with 100 tokens, the limit will be triggered even if the account did not use up 200K tokens in these 20 requests.

### [‚Äã](#1-5-rate-limits-subject) 1.5 Rate limits subject

1. Rate limits are defined at the user account level, not at the API key level.
2. Each model separately sets its own Rate Limits. Exceeding the Rate Limits for one model does not affect the normal use of other models.

## [‚Äã](#2-rate-limits-rules) 2. Rate limits rules

* The Rate limits for free models are fixed values, while those for paid models vary based on the account‚Äôs [usage level](https://account.siliconflow.cn/user/settings) and are displayed in the Rate Limits section.
* For the same usage level, the peak Rate Limits vary depending on the model category and the size of the model parameters.

### [‚Äã](#2-1-free-model-rate-limits) 2.1 Free model rate limits

1. After verifying your identity, you can use all free models.
2. Free model calls are free, and you will see the cost of these models as 0 in your [account bill](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/bills).
3. The Rate limits for free models are fixed. Some models are available in both free and paid versions. The free version is named after the original name, while the paid version is prefixed with ‚ÄúPro/‚Äù to distinguish it. For example, the free version of Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct is named ‚ÄúQwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct,‚Äù and the paid version is named ‚ÄúPro/Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct.‚Äù

### [‚Äã](#2-2-paid-model-rate-limits) 2.2 Paid model rate limits

1. You are charged based on usage. API calls are included in your [account bill](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/bills).
2. Rate Limits are tiered based on the account‚Äôs usage level. The peak Rate Limits increase with the usage level.
3. For the same usage level, the peak Rate Limits vary depending on the model category and the size of the model parameters.

### [‚Äã](#2-3-user-usage-level-and-rate-limits) 2.3 User usage level and rate limits

The platform categorizes accounts into different usage levels based on the monthly consumption amount. Each level has its own Rate Limits standards. When the monthly consumption reaches the criteria for a higher level, the account is automatically upgraded to that level. The upgrade takes effect immediately and provides more generous rate limits.

* Monthly consumption amount: This includes both the amount you recharge and any gifted amounts.
* Level setting: The highest consumption amount between the previous natural month and the current month (from the 1st to today) is used to determine the corresponding usage level. New users start at L0.

| Usage level | Qualification (in RMB) |
| --- | --- |
| L0 | Monthly highest consumption amount < ¬•50 |
| L1 | ¬•50 ‚â§ Monthly highest consumption amount < ¬•200 |
| L2 | ¬•200 ‚â§ Monthly highest consumption amount < ¬•2000 |
| L3 | ¬•2000 ‚â§ Monthly highest consumption amount < ¬•5000 |
| L4 | ¬•5000 ‚â§ Monthly highest consumption amount < ¬•10000 |
| L5 | ¬•10000 ‚â§ Monthly highest consumption amount |

### [‚Äã](#2-4-specific-model-rate-limits) 2.4 Specific model rate limits

The platform currently offers five categories: text generation, image generation, vectorization, re-ranking, and speech. Specific model rate limits can be found in the [models](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/models).

## [‚Äã](#3-handling-exceeding-rate-limits) 3. Handling exceeding rate limits

### [‚Äã](#3-1-error-messages-for-exceeding-rate-limits) 3.1 Error messages for exceeding rate limits

If the API call exceeds the Rate Limits, the user‚Äôs request will fail due to exceeding the Rate Limits. Users need to wait until the Rate Limits conditions are met before they can call again. The corresponding HTTP error message is:

Copy

```
    HTTP/1.1 429
    Too Many Requests
    Content Type: application/json
    Request was rejected due to rate limiting. If you want more, please contact contact@siliconflow.cn

```

### [‚Äã](#3-2-handling-exceeding-rate-limits) 3.2 Handling exceeding rate limits

* You can refer to the [Handling Rate Limits](https://github.com/siliconflow/siliconcloud-cookbook/blob/main/examples/how-to-handle-rate-limit-in-siliconcloud.ipynb) example to avoid errors under existing rate limits.
* You can also increase your usage level to increase the peak Rate Limits for your models.

## [‚Äã](#4-how-to-increase-model-rate-limits) 4. How to increase model rate limits

### [‚Äã](#4-1-ways-to-increase-rate-limits) 4.1 Ways to increase rate limits

* Automatic upgrade: You can increase your monthly consumption to increase your [monthly consumption amount](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/bills). When the consumption meets the criteria for a higher level, the account will be automatically upgraded.
* Quick Upgrade with Package: If you need to quickly reach a higher usage level and increase the peak Rate Limits, you can purchase a [package](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/package) to boost your usage level.

### [‚Äã](#4-2-package-purchase-details) 4.2 Package purchase details

* Online purchase: Please go to the platform to purchase the [package](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/package) online.
* Validity Period: Packages take effect immediately after purchase and are valid for the current month (N) and the next natural month (N+1). Starting from the month after next (N+2), the account‚Äôs latest usage level will be recalculated based on the consumption of the previous month (N+1).
* Payment method: Packages can only be paid with the platform‚Äôs recharge balance and cannot be paid with gifted balance.
* Invoice: For details on how to issue an invoice for packages, refer to the [invoice section](/faqs/invoice).
* Exclusive instances: Packages are not applicable for exclusive instance needs. If you have such needs, please contact your exclusive account manager.

### [‚Äã](#4-3-other-scenarios) 4.3 Other scenarios

* Contact Us: For scenarios not covered above, please [contact us](https://siliconflow.feishu.cn/share/base/form/shrcnaamvQ4C7YKMixVnS32k1G3).

## [‚Äã](#2-introduction-to-llms-txt) 2. Introduction to llms.txt

### [‚Äã](#2-1-protocol-background) 2.1 Protocol background

llms.txt is an emerging web standard designed to help large language models (LLMs) more effectively access and understand website content. By creating an llms.txt file in the root directory of a website, site owners can provide clear navigation and guidance to AI systems, thereby improving the efficiency of information retrieval.

### [‚Äã](#2-2-file-structure) 2.2 File structure

The llms.txt file is written in Markdown format and typically includes the following sections:

1. Title: Name of the website or project.
2. Description (optional): A brief introduction to the website or project.
3. Details (optional): Additional background information or links to other documents.
4. Chapters: List the important sections of the website, with each section containing links and optional detailed descriptions.

Example as follows (refer to the files <https://docs.siliconflow.cn/llms.txt> and <https://docs.siliconflow.cn/llms-full.txt>)

### [‚Äã](#2-3-file-functions) 2.3 File functions

#### [‚Äã](#2-3-1-%2Fllms-txt%EF%BC%9A) 2.3.1 /llms.txtÔºö

* Simplified navigation for large AI: This file provides a simplified view of the entire document navigation, making it easier for tools like Cursor or ChatGPT (LLMs) to index your content.
* Think of it as AI-friendly search engine optimization: users can now directly find specific product information through a general LLM.

#### [‚Äã](#2-3-2-%2Fllms-full-txt%EF%BC%9A) 2.3.2 /llms-full.txtÔºö

* The file compiles all document text into a marked-up file, facilitating AI tools to directly load information into their context windows based on this file.
* You can input the document into AI assistants like Cursor, allowing them to provide context-aware suggestions based on the specific details of your product.

### [‚Äã](#2-4-differences-from-existing-standards%3A) 2.4 Differences from existing standards:

While llms.txt overlaps in functionality with existing standards like robots.txt and sitemap.xml, their purposes and roles are different:

* robots.txtÔºöUsed to instruct search engine crawlers which pages can or cannot be crawled, primarily focusing on access control.
* sitemap.xmlÔºöProvides a structural map of the website to help search engines understand the layout of the pages, mainly for indexing purposes.
* llms.txtÔºöProvides a structured overview of content for large language models, helping AI systems better understand and process website information, enhancing interaction with AI.

## [‚Äã](#3-use-in-other-tools) 3. Use in other tools

Other platforms that support the [llms.txt protocol](https://llmstxt.org/),can also use it directly.
For example, in ChatGPT:

* [5. How to Perform Corporate Authentication?](#5-how-to-perform-corporate-authentication%3F)

## [‚Äã](#1-why-is-real-name-authentication-required%3F) 1. Why is Real-name Authentication Required?

According to the Cybersecurity Law of the People‚Äôs Republic of China and other laws and regulations, network operators are required to request users to provide real identity information when they handle network access and provide services. Users who do not provide real identity information cannot be provided with related services.

## [‚Äã](#2-what-impact-will-non-real-name-authentication-have-on-my-account%3F) 2. What Impact Will Non-real-name Authentication Have on My Account?

If you do not perform real-name authentication, your account will be unable to perform the following operations:

* Unable to perform ‚ÄúAccount Recharge‚Äù
* Unable to apply for ‚ÄúInvoice Issuance‚Äù

## [‚Äã](#3-what-are-the-differences-between-individual-and-corporate-real-name-authentication%3F) 3. What Are the Differences Between Individual and Corporate Real-name Authentication?

Account real-name authentication is divided into two types: Individual Real-name Authentication and Corporate Real-name Authentication:

* Individual Real-name Authentication: The authentication type is individual, and it supports individual facial recognition authentication.
* Corporate Real-name Authentication: The authentication type is corporate (including ordinary enterprises, government agencies, public institutions, social organizations, individual businesses, etc.), and it supports legal person facial recognition authentication and corporate public transfer authentication.

**Impact of Real-name Authentication on the Account:**

1. Affects Account Ownership:
   * An account that has completed corporate real-name authentication belongs to the company.
   * An account that has completed individual real-name authentication belongs to the individual.
2. Affects Invoice Information:
   * Corporate authentication can issue VAT special invoices and VAT general invoices with the company‚Äôs name.
   * Individual authentication can only issue VAT general invoices with the individual‚Äôs name.

„ÄêNote„Äë

* Real-name authentication information is very important for your account and financial security. Please authenticate based on your actual situation.
* For account security, corporate users should not perform individual real-name authentication.
* The current account can only be bound to one authentication subject. After the subject change is successful, the original subject information will be unbound from the account.

## [‚Äã](#4-how-to-perform-individual-authentication%3F) 4. How to Perform Individual Authentication?

### [‚Äã](#4-1-types-of-documents-supported-for-personal-verification) 4.1 Types of Documents Supported for Personal Verification

The types of documents supported for personal verification include:

* Resident Identity Card of Mainland China
* Hong Kong and Macao Residents‚Äô Permit for Travelling to and from Mainland China (Home Return Permit)
* Taiwan Residents‚Äô Permit for Travelling to and from Mainland China (Taiwan Compatriot Permit)
* Hong Kong and Macao Residents‚Äô Residence Permit
* Taiwan Residents‚Äô Residence Permit
* Foreigner‚Äôs Permanent Residence Permit

Users who do not possess any of the above documents are temporarily not supported for online personal verification and can communicate with staff through the [form](https://siliconflow.feishu.cn/share/base/form/shrcnF4a7pFS2eR4wJj9rneM7mc?auth_token=U7CK1RF-ddcuca83-7f21-437e-9ef2-208b950e9f7f-NN5W4&ccm_open_type=form_v1_qrcode_share&share_link_type=qrcode) to attempt other verification methods.

### [‚Äã](#4-2-personal-verification-process) 4.2 Personal Verification Process

1. Log in to the SiliconCloud platform and click on [User Center - Real-name] Authentication (<https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/account/authentication>).
2. On the real-name authentication page, select the authentication type as ‚ÄúIndividual Real-name Authentication‚Äù, then fill in your personal information.
3. Use the Alipay App on your phone to scan the QR code, scan it, and follow the prompts on your phone to complete the facial recognition authentication. After successful verification, click ‚ÄòFace Verification Completed‚Äô on the pop-up window in the web page.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/siliconflow-37161621/images/faqs/authentication/image.png)

4. After successful authentication, you can modify the authentication information or change to a corporate user. You can only complete one change or modification within 30 days.

„ÄêNote„Äë

* Real-name authentication directly affects the ownership of the account. If you are a corporate user, please perform corporate real-name authentication to avoid unnecessary disputes due to changes in personnel. For more information, see the differences between individual and corporate real-name authentication.
* According to relevant laws and regulations, we do not provide online real-name authentication services for individuals under 14 years old.

## [‚Äã](#5-how-to-perform-corporate-authentication%3F) 5. How to Perform Corporate Authentication?

1. Log in to the SiliconCloud platform and click on ‚ÄúUser Center - Real-name Authentication‚Äù.
2. On the real-name authentication page, select the authentication type as ‚ÄúCorporate Real-name Authentication‚Äù, and then choose the authentication method. There are two authentication methods:

* Choose Legal Person Facial Recognition Authentication
  1. Fill in the company name, unified social credit code, legal person‚Äôs name, and legal person‚Äôs ID number, and check the agreement.
  2. The legal person uses the Alipay App on their phone to scan the QR code, scan it, and follow the prompts on the phone to complete the facial recognition authentication. Once verified, the authentication is complete.
* Choose Corporate Public Transfer Authentication
  1. Fill in the company name, unified social credit code, and legal person‚Äôs name, and check the agreement.
  2. Fill in the corporate bank account number, the name of the bank (down to the branch), and the specific opening bank, confirm it, and then click to get the verification amount.
  3. Wait for the random transfer amount to arrive, usually within 10 minutes.
  4. After the transfer is successful, please verify the received random amount with finance and fill it back into this page. Once verified, the authentication is successful.

After successful authentication, you can modify the authentication information. You can only make one modification within 30 days.

## [‚Äã](#1-try-to-get-http-error-codes-to-initially-locate-the-problem) 1. Try to Get HTTP Error Codes to Initially Locate the Problem

a. In the code, try to print out the error codes and error messages (message). These can help you locate most of the issues.

Copy

```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Date: Thu, 19 Dec 2024 08:39:19 GMT
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 87
Connection: keep-alive

{"code":20012,"message":"Model does not exist. Please check it carefully.","data":null}

```

* Common error codes and reasons:
  + 400: Incorrect parameters. Please refer to the error message (message) to correct the invalid request parameters.
  + 401: Incorrect API Key setting.
  + 403: Insufficient permissions. The most common reason is that the model requires real-name authentication. Refer to the error message (message) for other cases.
  + 429: Triggered rate limit. Refer to the error message (message) to determine which specific type of rate limit (RPM /RPD / TPM / TPD / IPM / IPD), and refer to [Rate Limits](https://docs.siliconflow.cn/rate-limits/rate-limit-and-upgradation) for specific rate limit policies.
  + 504 / 503:
    Generally due to high service system load, try again later.
    For chat and text-to-speech requests, try using stream mode (‚Äústream‚Äù : true). Refer to [Stream Mode](https://docs.siliconflow.cn/faqs/stream-mode).
  + 500: An unknown service error. Contact relevant personnel for investigation.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/siliconflow-37161621/images/faqs/mic/image_3.png)

b. If the client does not output the corresponding information, you can consider running the curl command in the command line (for LLM models)

Copy

```
  curl --request POST \
      --url https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1/chat/completions \
      --header 'accept: application/json' \
      --header 'authorization: Bearer ÊîπÊàê‰Ω†ÁöÑapikey' \
      --header 'content-type: application/json' \
      --data '
  {
      "model": "ËÆ∞ÂæóÊîπÊ®°Âûã",
      "messages": [
        {

## [‚Äã](#1-model-output-encoding-issues) 1. Model Output Encoding Issues

Currently, some models are prone to encoding issues when parameters are not set. In such cases, you can try setting the parameters such as `temperature`, `top_k`, `top_p`, and `frequency_penalty`.
Modify the payload as follows, adjusting as needed for different languages:

Copy

```
    payload = {
        "model": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct",
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "1+1=?",
            }
        ],
        "max_tokens": 200,  # ÊåâÈúÄÊ∑ªÂä†
        "temperature": 0.7, # ÊåâÈúÄÊ∑ªÂä†
        "top_k": 50,        # ÊåâÈúÄÊ∑ªÂä†
        "top_p": 0.7,       # ÊåâÈúÄÊ∑ªÂä†
        "frequency_penalty": 0 # ÊåâÈúÄÊ∑ªÂä†
    }

```

## [‚Äã](#2-explanation-of-max-tokens) 2.Explanation of max\_tokens

For the LLM models provided by the platform:

* The model with a max\_tokens limit of `16384`:
  + deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1
  + Pro/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1
  + Qwen/QVQ-72B-Preview
  + deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
  + deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B
  + deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B
  + Pro/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B
* The model with a max\_tokens limit of `4096`:
  + Other LLM models aside from those mentioned above

If you have special requirements, please provide feedback by clicking on the [SiliconCloud MaaS Online Requirement Collection Form](https://m09tqret04o.feishu.cn/share/base/form/shrcnaamvQ4C7YKMixVnS32k1G3).

## [‚Äã](#3-explanation-of-context-length) 3.Explanation of context\_length

The context\_length varies for different LLM models. You can search for the specific model on the [Models](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/models) to view the model details.

## [‚Äã](#4-what-are-the-differences-between-pro-and-non-pro-models) 4. What Are the Differences Between Pro and Non-Pro Models

1. For some models, the platform provides both a free version and a paid version. The free version is named as is, while the paid version is prefixed with ‚ÄúPro/‚Äù to distinguish it. The free version has fixed Rate Limits, whereas the paid version has variable Rate Limits. For specific rules, please refer to: [Rate Limits](https://docs.siliconflow.cn/cn/userguide/rate-limits/rate-limit-and-upgradation).
2. For the `DeepSeek R1` and `DeepSeek V3` models, the platform distinguishes and names them based on the payment method. The Pro version only supports payment with recharged balance, while the non-Pro version supports payment with both granted balance and recharged balance.

## [‚Äã](#5-are-there-any-time-and-quality-requirements-for-custom-voice-samples-in-the-voice-models) 5. Are There Any Time and Quality Requirements for Custom Voice Samples in the Voice Models

* For cosyvoice2, the custom voice sample must be less than 30 seconds.

To ensure the quality of the generated voice, it is recommended that users upload a voice sample that is 8 to 10 seconds long, with clear pronunciation and no background noise or interference.

## [‚Äã](#6-output-truncation-issues-in-model-inference) 6. Output Truncation Issues in Model Inference

Here are several aspects to troubleshoot the issue:

* When encountering output truncation through API requests:
  + Max Tokens Setting: Set the max\_token to an appropriate value. If the output exceeds the max\_token, it will be truncated. For the deepseek R1 series, the max\_token can be set up to 16,384.
  + Stream Request Setting: In non-stream requests, long output content is prone to 504 timeout issues.
  + Client Timeout Setting: Increase the client timeout to prevent truncation before the output is fully completed.
* When encountering output truncation through third-party client requests:
  + CherryStdio has a default max\_tokens of 4,096. Users can enable the ‚ÄúEnable Message Length Limit‚Äù switch to set the max\_token to an appropriate value.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/siliconflow-37161621/images/faqs/mic/image_5.png)

## [‚Äã](#7-troubleshooting-429-error-during-model-usage) 7. Troubleshooting 429 Error During Model Usage

Here are some areas to check for the issue:

* General Users: Verify your user tier and the corresponding Rate Limits (rate limits) for the model. If the request exceeds the Rate Limits, consider retrying after some time.
* Dedicated Instance Users: Dedicated instances typically do not have Rate Limits. If a 429 error occurs, first confirm whether the correct model name for the dedicated instance is being called, and check if the api\_key used matches the dedicated instance.

## [‚Äã](#8-account-balance-insufficient-despite-successful-recharge) 8. Account Balance Insufficient Despite Successful Recharge

Here are some areas to check for the issue:

* Ensure the api\_key being used matches the account that was just recharged.
* If the api\_key is correct, there may be a network delay during the recharge process. Consider waiting a few minutes and then retry.

## [‚Äã](#9-unable-to-access-certain-models-despite-completing-real-name-verification) 9. Unable to Access Certain Models Despite Completing Real-name Verification

Here are some areas to check for the issue:

* Confirm that the api\_key being used matches the account that completed real-name verification.
* If the api\_key is correct, visit the Real-name Verification page to check the verification status. If the status shows ‚ÄúVerification in Progress,‚Äù you can try canceling and re-verifying.

## [‚Äã](#3-why-can%E2%80%99t-my-phone-number-be-registered-or-bound%3F) 3. Why can‚Äôt my phone number be registered or bound?

To ensure the security of user accounts and service experience on the platform, we have placed registration and binding restrictions on certain phone number segments that may pose security risks (such as those from some virtual operators). This measure aims to provide you with a safer and more stable service environment and reduce potential interference or impact caused by malicious activities on normal use.
We recommend that you use a regular phone number provided by common Chinese mainland operators (such as China Mobile, China Unicom, and China Telecom) for registration or binding.

## [‚Äã](#1-using-stream-mode-in-python) 1. Using Stream Mode in Python

### [‚Äã](#1-1-stream-mode-with-the-openai-library) 1.1 Stream Mode with the OpenAI Library

It is recommended to use the OpenAI library for stream mode in most scenarios.

Copy

```
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url='https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1',
    api_key='your-api-key'
)

# ÂèëÈÄÅÂ∏¶ÊúâÊµÅÂºèËæìÂá∫ÁöÑËØ∑Ê±Ç

)

# ÈÄêÊ≠•Êé•Êî∂Âπ∂Â§ÑÁêÜÂìçÂ∫î
for chunk in response:
    if not chunk.choices:
        continue
    if chunk.choices[0].delta.content:
        print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content, end="", flush=True)
    if chunk.choices[0].delta.reasoning_content:
        print(chunk.choices[0].delta.reasoning_content, end="", flush=True)

```

### [‚Äã](#1-2-stream-mode-with-the-requests-library) 1.2 Stream Mode with the Requests Library

If you are using the requests library for non-OpenAI scenarios, such as using the SiliconCloud API, you need to ensure that both the payload and the request parameters are set to stream mode.

Copy

```
from openai import OpenAI
import requests
import json
   
url = "https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1/chat/completions"
   
payload = {
        "model": "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V2.5", # ÊõøÊç¢Êàê‰Ω†ÁöÑÊ®°Âûã
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "SiliconCloudÂÖ¨Êµã‰∏äÁ∫øÔºåÊØèÁî®Êà∑ÈÄÅ3‰∫øtoken Ëß£ÈîÅÂºÄÊ∫êÂ§ßÊ®°ÂûãÂàõÊñ∞ËÉΩÂäõ„ÄÇÂØπ‰∫éÊï¥‰∏™Â§ßÊ®°ÂûãÂ∫îÁî®È¢ÜÂüüÂ∏¶Êù•Âì™‰∫õÊîπÂèòÔºü"
            }
        ],
        "stream": True # Ê≠§Â§ÑÈúÄË¶ÅËÆæÁΩÆ‰∏∫streamÊ®°Âºè
}

headers = {
        "accept": "application/json",
        "content-type": "application/json",
        "authorization": "Bearer your-api-key"
    }
   
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers, stream=True) # Ê≠§Â§ÑrequestÈúÄË¶ÅÊåáÂÆöstreamÊ®°Âºè

# ÊâìÂç∞ÊµÅÂºèËøîÂõû‰ø°ÊÅØ
if response.status_code == 200:
    full_content = ""
    full_reasoning_content = ""

    for chunk in response.iter_lines():
        if chunk:
            chunk_str = chunk.decode('utf-8').replace('data: ', '')
            if chunk_str != "[DONE]":
                chunk_data = json.loads(chunk_str)
                delta = chunk_data['choices'][0].get('delta', {})
                content = delta.get('content', '')
                reasoning_content = delta.get('reasoning_content', '')
                if content:
                    print(content, end="", flush=True)
                    full_content += content
                if reasoning_content:
                    print(reasoning_content, end="", flush=True)
                    full_reasoning_content += reasoning_content
else:
    print(f"ËØ∑Ê±ÇÂ§±Ë¥•ÔºåÁä∂ÊÄÅÁ†ÅÔºö{response.status_code}")

```

## [‚Äã](#2-using-stream-mode-in-curl) 2. Using Stream Mode in curl

By default, the processing mechanism of the curl command buffers the output stream, so even if the server sends data in chunks, you will only see the content after the buffer is filled or the connection is closed. Passing the `-N` (or `--no-buffer`) option disables this buffering, allowing chunks of data to be printed to the terminal immediately, thus achieving streaming output.

Copy

```
curl -N -s \
  --request POST \
  --url https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1/chat/completions \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer token' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "model": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct",
    "messages": [
      {"role":"user","content":"ÊúâËØ∫Ë¥ùÂ∞îÊï∞Â≠¶Â•ñÂêóÔºü"}
    ],
    "stream": true
}'

## [‚Äã](#1-about-bob) 1. About Bob

[Bob](https://bobtranslate.com) is a translation and OCR software for macOS that you can use in any application for quick and efficient translation and OCR. It is simple, fast, and effective!
This article will introduce how to use the API services provided by SiliconCloud to perform translations in Bob.

## [‚Äã](#2-installing-bob) 2. Installing Bob

Go to the Mac App Store to install Bob. [Install on Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/id1630034110)

## [‚Äã](#3-using-siliconcloud-in-bob) 3. Using SiliconCloud in Bob

### [‚Äã](#3-1-default-configuration) 3.1 Default Configuration

After installing Bob, select any text in any application and press the `‚å•` `D` shortcut to translate. SiliconCloud‚Äôs free model will be used as the default translation service, as shown in the image below.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/siliconflow-37161621/images/usercases/bob/siliconflow-use-1.png)

### [‚Äã](#3-2-using-other-free-models-from-siliconcloud) 3.2 Using Other Free Models from SiliconCloud

The default model used is `Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct`. You can **right-click** the service icon in the top-right corner of the translation window to go to the ‚ÄúTranslation - Services‚Äù page and switch to other free models.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/siliconflow-37161621/images/usercases/bob/siliconflow-use-2.png)

As shown in the image below, the models marked as **Free** can be used directly.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/siliconflow-37161621/images/usercases/bob/siliconflow-use-3.png)

### [‚Äã](#3-3-using-other-text-generation-models-from-siliconcloud) 3.3 Using Other Text Generation Models from SiliconCloud

To use models that are not marked as free, you need to obtain a SiliconCloud API Key.

1. Go to the [SiliconCloud official website](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/) and register an account (or log in if you already have one).
2. After registering, open the [API Keys](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/account/ak) page and create a new API Key. Click to copy the key for future use.
3. Go to the previously mentioned ‚ÄúTranslation - Services‚Äù page in Bob, paste the API Key into the **SiliconFlow Translation** service‚Äôs API Key setting, then switch to the desired model and click save to start using it.

## [‚Äã](#about-chat2graph) About Chat2Graph

[Chat2Graph](https://github.com/TuGraph-family/chat2graph) is a **Graph Native Agentic System** designed to enhance key capabilities of agents‚Äîsuch as reasoning, planning, memory, knowledge, and tool collaboration‚Äîby leveraging the symbolic strengths of graph data structures, including relational modeling and interpretability. It also promotes the intelligence of graph databases, lowers the threshold for graph usage, accelerates content generation, and enables natural interaction with graphs. The project aims to deeply integrate graph computing technologies with artificial intelligence.

## [√¢‚Ç¨‚Äπ](#1-introduction) 1. Introduction

Deep Research Web UI is an AI-powered research assistant that combines search engines, web scraping, and large language models to enable the AI to search for information based on a question, continuously dig deeper, and finally output a research report.
Features of this project:

* ƒü≈∏‚Äô¬∞ **Low cost**: Achieve √¢‚Ç¨≈ìdeep research√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ results similar to ChatGPT, Perplexity, MITA, etc., at a very low cost.
* ƒü≈∏≈°‚Ç¨ **Privacy & security**: All configurations and API requests are performed on the browser side and can be self-hosted.
* ƒü≈∏‚Ä¢‚Ñ¢ **Real-time feedback**: AI responses are streamed and displayed in real time on the interface.
* ƒü≈∏≈í¬≥ **Search visualization**: Displays the research process using a tree structure, supporting English search terms.
* ƒü≈∏‚Äú‚Äû **PDF export support**: Export the final research report in Markdown and PDF formats.
* ƒü≈∏¬§‚Äì **Multi-model support**: Uses pure prompts instead of structured outputs, making it compatible with more large model providers.

This project is open-source on [GitHub](https://github.com/AnotiaWang/deep-research-web-ui).

## [√¢‚Ç¨‚Äπ](#2-how-to-use) 2. How to Use

Open the [Deep Research Web UI official website](https://deep-research.ataw.top), and click the √¢‚Ç¨≈ì√¢≈°‚Ñ¢√Ø¬∏ÔøΩ√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ button in the top right corner to open the settings popup.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/siliconflow-37161621/images/usercases/deep-research/deep-research-showcase-1.webp)

### [√¢‚Ç¨‚Äπ](#2-1-configure-ai-large-model-service) 2.1 Configure AI Large Model Service

1. Register or log in to an account on the SiliconFlow official website.
2. Generate a new API key in [API Keys](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/account/ak), and copy it.
3. Go back to the Deep Research webpage, and in the AI service settings section, select √¢‚Ç¨≈ìSiliconFlow√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ, then paste the generated API key in the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAPI Key√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ field.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/siliconflow-37161621/images/usercases/deep-research/deep-research-showcase-2.webp)

4. In the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìModel Name√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ field, click the dropdown button on the right (you can also enter the model name in the input box to filter), and select the model you want to use.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/siliconflow-37161621/images/usercases/deep-research/deep-research-showcase-3.webp)

5. (Optional) Set the context length: If you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re doing large-scale research, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s recommended to configure the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìcontext length√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ option. Do not exceed the maximum context length of the selected model to avoid request failures.

### [√¢‚Ç¨‚Äπ](#2-2-configure-networked-search-models) 2.2 Configure Networked Search Models

Currently, Tavily and Firecrawl are supported, and more search services will be added in the future. Here we choose Tavily, as it provides 1,000 free searches per month, which is sufficient for most scenarios.

1. Register an account on the [Tavily official website](https://app.tavily.com/home), then create a new API key in the console and copy it.
   * The Key Name can be set as √¢‚Ç¨≈ìDeep Research√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ.
   * The Key Type depends on your usage: for light usage, choose √¢‚Ç¨≈ìDevelopment√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ; for heavy usage, choose √¢‚Ç¨≈ìProduction√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ, which supports a higher request frequency.
   * Be sure to keep your API key safe and do not disclose it.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/siliconflow-37161621/images/usercases/deep-research/deep-research-showcase-4.webp)

2. Go back to the Deep Research webpage, in the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìNetworked Search Service√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ section, select √¢‚Ç¨≈ìTavily√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ and paste the generated API key in the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAPI Key√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ field.
3. (Optional) Set the language used for searching. The AI model will by default use the current language of your webpage to search and reply. However, if you want to use English search terms to find higher-quality information, you can set the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìLanguage√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ to English.

Now, everything is set up, and you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re ready to start using it!

### [√¢‚Ç¨‚Äπ](#3-getting-started) 3. Getting Started

Each step of this project is clearly explained to reduce the learning curve. You can use it to find first-hand materials, understand topics you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re interested in, search for news, and summarize, etc. For example, search for information about NVIDIA RTX 50 series graphics cards:

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/siliconflow-37161621/images/usercases/deep-research/deep-research-showcase-5.webp)

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/siliconflow-37161621/images/usercases/deep-research/deep-research-showcase-6.webp)

This project is actively being updated. If you encounter any issues, feel free to report them on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AnotiaWang/deep-research-web-ui).

1. Clone MindSearch to your local machine and install the required dependencies (refer to <https://github.com/InternLM/MindSearch/blob/main/README.md>).
2. Modify:
   `/path/to/MindSearch/mindsearch/models.py`
3. Add the configuration for calling the SiliconCloud API. The configuration is as follows:

Copy

```
internlm_silicon = dict(type=GPTAPI,
                        model_type='internlm/internlm2_5-7b-chat',
                        key=os.environ.get('SILICON_API_KEY', 'YOUR SILICON API KEY'),
                        openai_api_base='https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1/chat/completions',
                        meta_template=[
                            dict(role='system', api_role='system'),
                            dict(role='user', api_role='user'),
                            dict(role='assistant', api_role='assistant'),
                            dict(role='environment', api_role='system')
                        ],
                        top_p=0.8,
                        top_k=1,
                        temperature=0,
                        max_new_tokens=8192,
                        repetition_penalty=1.02,
                        stop_words=['<|im_end|>'])

```

After adding this configuration, you can execute the relevant commands to start MindSearch.

4. Start the backend:

Copy

```
# ÊåáÂÆöÁ°ÖÂü∫ÊµÅÂä®ÁöÑ API Key
export SILICON_API_KEY=‰∏äÈù¢ÊµÅÁ®ã‰∏≠Â§çÂà∂ÁöÑÂØÜÈí•

## [‚Äã](#introduction) Introduction

[translate.js](https://gitee.com/mail_osc/translate) is an AI-powered i18n solution designed for frontend developers.  
It focuses on seamless multilingual switching capabilities‚Äîjust two lines of JavaScript to automatically translate your entire HTML page.  
With support for over 100 languages, you can switch languages with a single click. No need to modify your page, no language config files required.
It also supports [dozens of fine-tuning directives](https://gitee.com/mail_osc/translate) to meet all your customization needs, and is SEO-friendly.  
translate.js is open-sourced under the MIT License: [GitHub](https://github.com/xnx3/translate) | [Gitee](https://gitee.com/mail_osc/translate) ‚Äî completely free and commercially usable.
This article will guide you through how to enable multilingual switching on your website using the API service provided by [SiliconFlow](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/i/64MyJQtM).

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/siliconflow-37161621/images/usercases/translate-js/html_demo.gif)

## [‚Äã](#model-optimization) Model Optimization

When it comes to translation, you might immediately think of a typical scenario: entering a sentence into a text box, followed by something like ‚ÄúTranslate this into XXX language.‚Äù  
But this is not how it works here.
Large language models offer significantly better translation quality compared to traditional machine translation. However, in real-world online applications, stable and reliable output is essential.
This system has undergone deep optimization and multiple layers of self-check and correction specifically for practical translation scenarios using large (and small) models. The goal is to ensure consistent and dependable performance. For a more in-depth discussion, see [here](https://e.gitee.com/leimingyun/doc/share/6d69716d52be98f0/?sub_id=14253611#%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B%E4%BC%98%E5%8C%96).
In simple terms, using [SiliconCloud](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/i/64MyJQtM), you can translate irregular sentences, mixed-language texts, and grammatically awkward phrases. The output not only offers smoother readability than traditional machine translation, but also matches its lightning-fast response speed.

## [‚Äã](#quick-start) Quick Start

No prior setup or registration is required ‚Äî you can get started with just a few lines of JavaScript.

### [‚Äã](#code) Code

Simply add the following code to the **bottom** of your existing HTML file to enable integration:

Copy

```
<script src="https://cdn.staticfile.net/translate.js/3.15.6/translate.min.js"></script>
<script>
translate.service.use('siliconflow'); //Set to use SiliconFlow‚Äôs translation channel
translate.execute(); //Trigger translation
</script>

```

### [‚Äã](#description) Description

Simply add the line `translate.service.use('siliconflow');` in your JavaScript to use the free Qwen3-8B translation model provided by [SiliconCloud](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/i/64MyJQtM).  
We‚Äôve deeply integrated SiliconCloud, so no further configuration is required.
translate.js is supported by server sponsorship from [ZhiDianYun](https://www.zhidianyun.cn/?i125cc1), which converts large language models into translation APIs and makes them available for use in translate.js.  
With server nodes across Asia, Europe, and the Americas, it ensures smooth performance for users worldwide.
If you run into any issues during integration, you can [report them here](https://gitee.com/mail_osc/translate/issues), or join the QQ group (1034085260) to contact the author for help.

### [‚Äã](#fine-tuning-commands) Fine-Tuning Commands

translate.js offers a wide range of advanced commands, allowing precise customization to meet various user demands ‚Äî even the most unusual ones. (If something‚Äôs missing, feel free to suggest it in the QQ group above.)

## [‚Äã](#private-deployment-with-siliconcloud) Private Deployment with SiliconCloud

You can register your own account at [SiliconCloud](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/i/64MyJQtM) and deploy this service privately to enable more advanced configurations and significantly improve the user experience.

### [‚Äã](#advantages) Advantages

* **Translation Quality**: You can connect to larger models provided by [SiliconCloud](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/i/64MyJQtM), such as Qwen3-32B, to produce more fluent translations and deliver an outstanding reading experience.
* **Lightning-Fast Response**: Enable [memory caching](https://translate.zvo.cn/391130.html) to dramatically increase API response speed.
* **Usage Limits**: Set [usage limits](https://translate.zvo.cn/391130.html) for a specific domain (or API key). This is especially useful for network service providers who want to sell translation services in a tiered package model.
* **Management Interface**: Use the open [management API](https://doc.zvo.cn/translate.service/20250312/admin.getCache.json.html) to monitor real-time usage data such as which domains or keys are active, how many characters have been translated, and more.
* **Data Privacy**: All API requests and cached data are hosted on your own server, ensuring complete data privacy.
* **Concurrency Control**: Freely define the [maximum number of concurrent requests per second](https://translate.zvo.cn/413975.html) and configure the [thread pool size](https://translate.zvo.cn/391753.html) when calling large models to greatly reduce interface latency. You can also use the management API to monitor real-time concurrency.

### [‚Äã](#deployment) Deployment

#### [‚Äã](#1-server-specifications) 1. Server Specifications

* **CPU**: 1 core
* **Architecture**: x86\_64 (i.e., Intel CPU)
* **Memory**: 1 GB
* **Operating System**:
  1. CentOS 7.4 (Other 7.x versions like 7.6, 7.2 are also acceptable)
  2. openEuler 20 (If version 20 is not available, version 22 is also fine)
* **System Disk**: Use the default system disk; no data disk is needed
* **Elastic Public IP**: Pay by traffic (10 Mbps bandwidth recommended. For personal use with low translation volume, 1 Mbps bandwidth is sufficient)
* **Region**: Choose a mainland China region for faster access to the SiliconCloud API.
  For any unspecified options, simply choose the cheapest available.

#### [‚Äã](#2-one-click-deployment) 2. One-Click Deployment

Run the following shell command to deploy with a single click:

Copy

```
yum -y install wget && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xnx3/translate/refs/heads/master/deploy/service.sh -O ~/install.sh && chmod -R 777 ~/install.sh && sh ~/install.sh

```

#### [‚Äã](#3-obtain-the-api-key) 3. Obtain the API Key

1. Go to [SiliconFlow](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/i/64MyJQtM) and register an account.
2. On the left side of the console, find **Account Management** > **API Key**, open it, and create a new one.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/siliconflow-37161621/images/usercases/translate-js/1.png)

#### [‚Äã](#4-configure-the-api-key) 4. Configure the API Key

First, locate the configuration file `/mnt/service/config.properties` and edit it. Find:

Copy

```
translate.service.leimingyun.domain=http://api.translate.zvo.cn

```

Comment this line out (this is the default trial service), and then add the following configuration:

Copy

```
# This URL is fixed and does not need to be changed  
translate.service.openai.url=https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1/chat/completions

# Specify which large model to use. For example, you can fill in Qwen/Qwen3-32B here.  
# Available models can be found at https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/models  
translate.service.openai.model=Qwen/Qwen3-32B

# Your SiliconFlow API key, obtained in the previous step, should be entered here  
translate.service.openai.key=sk-kqpnpfhlikgacrmdab2946d28eb00ede7acd9b3axfiIadf4P81

# Number of threads in the thread pool for calling the large model API.  
# If you're unsure, set it to 100.  
# For detailed explanation of this parameter, refer to http://translate.zvo.cn/396728.html  
translate.service.thread.number=100

```

Of course, there are more configuration options available to unlock advanced capabilities.  
These can be ignored during the initial setup phase, but you may explore them as you become more familiar:

* [Translation Accuracy Validation and Auto-Correction](https://translate.zvo.cn/411064.html)
* [Configure Language Routing Strategy for Multiple Translation Channels](https://translate.zvo.cn/426176.html)
* [Configure Traffic Control for Translation API Interface](https://translate.zvo.cn/413975.html)
* [Configure Backup Translation Channels](https://translate.zvo.cn/404947.html)
* ‚Ä¶

#### [‚Äã](#5-restart-the-project) 5. Restart the Project

After completing the above steps, restart the `translate.service` by executing the restart command:

Copy

```
/mnt/service/start.sh

```

#### [‚Äã](#6-access-and-test) 6. Access and Test

Simply visit your server‚Äôs IP address to see it in action:

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/siliconflow-37161621/images/usercases/translate-js/2.png)

Try switching to any language. If ‚ÄúHello, world‚Äù gets translated after switching, it means the integration is successful and ready for use.

### [‚Äã](#usage) Usage

#### [‚Äã](#text-translation-api-interface) Text Translation API Interface

This service is powered by large model capabilities provided by the [SiliconFlow](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/i/64MyJQtM) platform, with [translate.service](https://gitee.com/mail_osc/translate) acting as the middleware for dispatching.
You don‚Äôt need to understand what large models are or how to use them. A standard API translation interface is exposed for you to use directly.
**Request URL**: [http://your-server-ip/translate.json](http://api.zvo.cn/translate/service/20230807/translate.json.html)  
**Request Method**: POST  
**Request Parameters**:

* **to** ‚Äì Target language for translation. For example, `english`. More supported languages can be found by visiting [http://your-server-ip/language.json](http://api.zvo.cn/translate/service/20230807/language.json.html)
* **text** ‚Äì The text(s) to translate. Format should be a JSON array, e.g., `["Hello", "World"]`.  
  It supports translating multiple different texts at once, and each text can be in a different language.

**Response Example**:
`{"result":1,"info":"success","to":"english","text":["Hello","World"]}`
Note:The Content-Type header should either be unset or set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
**curl Translation Example:**
To help you better understand how to use the API, here is a curl request example.
You can copy and run it directly to see the effect:

Copy

```
curl --request POST \
  --url https://siliconflow.zvo.cn/translate.json \
  --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data to=english \
  ‚Äìdata ‚Äòtext=[‚ÄúHello, world‚Äù,‚ÄúLet‚Äôs explore the stars and the sea‚Äù]‚Äô

```

It‚Äôs open and free ‚Äî no need to purchase expensive text translation services anymore.  
SiliconFlow provides it for free, with even better translation fluency!
[Click here to view the detailed documentation of the text translation API interface](http://api.zvo.cn/translate/service/20230807/translate.json.html)

#### [‚Äã](#web-page-multi-language-switching) Web Page Multi-language Switching

To enable this feature, add the following code just before the closing `</html>` tag at the end of your webpage.  
Typically, a language selection `<select>` dropdown will appear at the bottom of the page, allowing you to switch languages and see the effect in real time.

Copy

```
<script src="https://cdn.staticfile.net/translate.js/3.15.6/translate.min.js"></script>
<script>
translate.service.use('translate.service'); // Set to use the self-hosted translation channel. See https://translate.zvo.cn/4081.html for more details.
translate.request.api.host = 'http://121.121.121.121/'; // Replace the IP address here with your server's IP. Don't forget the leading http:// and the trailing slash /
translate.execute(); // Trigger the translation
</script>

```

This way, the translation request interface will go through your own server.  
For detailed documentation on manually specifying the translation API, refer to: [http://translate.zvo.cn/4068.html](https://gitee.com/link?target=http%3A%2F%2Ftranslate.zvo.cn%2F4068.html)
Additionally, you can download the `translate.js` file and host it within your own project. It has no external dependencies and is written in pure, native JavaScript.  
`translate.js` is fully open-source, and you can always get the latest version from:  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xnx3/translate/refs/heads/master/translate.js/translate.js](https://gitee.com/link?target=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fxnx3%2Ftranslate%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmaster%2Ftranslate.js%2Ftranslate.js)
The core mechanism works by scanning the DOM elements on your web page to automatically identify and extract text content for translation.
This is why the `translate.execute();` call must be placed at the very bottom of the page ‚Äî it ensures that all DOM elements have been rendered before triggering the translation process across the entire page.

### [‚Äã](#log-viewing) Log Viewing

You can check the relevant logs directly on your server.  
Logs are stored in the `/mnt/service/logs/` directory.

#### [‚Äã](#text-translation-logs) Text Translation Logs

Files named `openai_yyyy-MM-dd.log` contain logs of text translations performed using the large model via the OpenAI interface provided by SiliconFlow.
For example: `openai_2025-05-17.log`  
Here, `yyyy-MM-dd` refers to the current date. A new log file is generated daily based on the date.
Each log entry records the original text, the translated text, the translation timestamp, the translation quality review score, whether the repair mechanism was triggered, and more.  
Each line in the file represents one translation record.
Example:

Copy

```
{"time":"00:40:59","originalText":"Button switch language:","resultText":"Button switch language:","to":"english","useTime":583,"score":96}
{"time":"00:40:59","originalText":"Language Switching Example:","resultText":"Language Switching Example:","to":"english","useTime":482,"score":96}
{"time":"00:40:59","originalText":"Hello","resultText":"Hello","to":"english","useTime":546,"score":96}

```

* **time** ‚Äî The timestamp when the event occurred
* **originalText** ‚Äî The original text to be translated
* **resultText** ‚Äî The translated text
* **to** ‚Äî The target language for the translation
* **score** ‚Äî The quality score of the translated text after verification, ranging from 1 to 100. Higher scores indicate more accurate translations
* **useTime** ‚Äî The time taken for the translation using [SiliconCloud](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/i/64MyJQtM), measured in milliseconds

#### [‚Äã](#system-operation-logs) System Operation Logs

`translate.service.log` is the system operation log that records the runtime status of the translate.service itself.

#### [‚Äã](#access-request-logs) Access Request Logs

`request_yyyy-MM-dd.log` contains logs of translation requests made to `/translate.json`.  
The logs are not written immediately after each request; instead, they are buffered and written to the log file either when the number of entries reaches several hundred or when more than 2 minutes have passed since the last write operation.  
Here are two sample entries:

Copy

```
{"method":"translate.json","size":4,"ip":"192.168.31.95","domain":"192.168.31.95","memoryCacheHitsSize":5,"time":"2025-03-19 10:22:56","memoryCacheHitsNumber":1,"to":"english"}
{"fileCache":"1845bbcbd9e600fab184b346d82042a9_english.txt","method":"translate.json","size":4,"ip":"192.168.31.95","domain":"192.168.31.95","time":"2025-03-19 10:26:56","to":"english"}

```

* **method** ‚Äî The API endpoint of the current request. For example, `translate.json` refers to the text translation API; `language.json` refers to the API that retrieves the list of supported languages.
* **fileCache** ‚Äî For requests to the `translate.json` translation API, if a file cache hit occurs, this parameter records the name of the cached file, which is stored in `/mnt/service/cache/`.
* **originalSize** ‚Äî For requests to the `translate.json` translation API, records the character count of the original text (source text, not the translation).
* **size** ‚Äî For requests to the `translate.json` translation API, records the character count of the translated text (translation, not the source).
* **ip** ‚Äî The IP address from which the request originated.
* **domain** ‚Äî For requests to the `translate.json` translation API, if the website uses `translate.js`, this is the domain name of that website (automatically detected).
* **time** ‚Äî The timestamp when the request was triggered.
* **to** ‚Äî For requests to the `translate.json` translation API, the target language of the translation.
* **key** ‚Äî For requests to the `translate.json` translation API, if you have assigned a translation key via `domain.json` configuration, this records that key.
* **memoryCacheHitsNumber** ‚Äî For requests to the `translate.json` translation API, if an in-memory cache hit occurs, this records the number of cache hits (since `translate.json` supports translating multiple texts at once).
* **memoryCacheHitsSize** ‚Äî For requests to the `translate.json` translation API, if an in-memory cache hit occurs, this records the number of characters hit in the cache (translation text character count, not the source).

## [‚Äã](#about-wiseflow) About wiseflow

[wiseflow](https://github.com/TeamWiseFlow/wiseflow/) (Chinese name: AI Chief Intelligence Officer) is an open-source application that leverages large language models to help users discover genuinely interesting information from vast amounts of data and diverse sources on a daily basis.
Unlike **‚Äòdeep search‚Äô** tools such as ChatGPT and Manus, wiseflow is designed for **‚Äòwide search‚Äô**, making it particularly suitable for scenarios that require broad information collection such as industry intelligence, customer insights, bidding information, competitor dynamics, public opinion monitoring, and knowledge intelligence. Compared to traditional RPA-based crawlers, the project also supports a plug-and-play experience that eliminates the need for manual XPath extraction, using large models to strictly analyze, filter, and summarize each piece of information according to user-defined focus points.
wiseflow has just released its brand-new version 4.0. In addition to existing sources like regular web pages, RSS, and search engines, it now supports platforms such as Weibo and Kuaishou. Future versions in the 4.x series will gradually add support for platforms including WeChat Official Accounts, Douyin, Xiaohongshu, Bilibili, and Zhihu. The 4.0 release also features a significant architectural overhaul, resulting in improved stability, speed, and memory efficiency.

## [‚Äã](#how-to-use) How to Use

**Since version 3.1, wiseflow has recommended using LLM services provided by SiliconFlow. Version 4.0 further simplifies the setup process‚Äîjust three steps to get started!**

Tip: Windows users should download the Git Bash tool in advance and run the following commands in Bash. [Download Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)

### [‚Äã](#download-the-project-source-code-and-install-uv-and-pocketbase) Download the Project Source Code and Install uv and PocketBase

Copy

```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
git clone https://github.com/TeamWiseFlow/wiseflow.git

```

The above steps will complete the installation of `uv`.
Next, go to the [PocketBase documentation](https://pocketbase.io/docs/) to download the PocketBase executable compatible with your operating system, and place it in the `wiseflow/pb` directory.
**Note:** If you‚Äôre using macOS, after completing this step, navigate to the `wiseflow/pb` folder and run the following command once:

Copy

```
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine pocketbase

```

### [‚Äã](#configure-the-env-file-based-on-env-sample) Configure the `.env` File Based on `env_sample`

First, in the `wiseflow` directory (the project root), create a `.env` file based on the `env_sample` file and fill in the necessary configuration values.
**Now it‚Äôs time for SiliconFlow to take the stage!**

* Visit the [SiliconFlow official website](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/) and register an account (or log in if you already have one);
* After registration, go to the [API Key page](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/account/ak) and create a new API Key;
* Click to copy the key, then paste it into the `LLM_API_KEY` field of the `.env` file you created earlier. Also set `LLM_API_BASE` to `https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1`.

A sample `.env` file might look like this:

Copy

```
LLM_API_KEY=your_api_key 
LLM_API_BASE=https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1 # LLM service endpoint
PRIMARY_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen3-14B # Recommended: Qwen3-14B or similar reasoning-capable models
VL_MODEL=Pro/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct

```

For wide-range information gathering tasks like wiseflow‚Äôs, the Qwen3-14B model is already quite effective. The VL\_MODEL is auxiliary‚ÄîQwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct will also suffice. wiseflow is optimized for smaller models, but if your use case involves strict constraints and lots of proprietary terms, you may consider using a larger model like Qwen3-32B.
Refer to [docs/manual/manual.md](https://github.com/TeamWiseFlow/wiseflow/blob/master/docs/manual/manual.md) for more .env configuration options.

### [‚Äã](#launch) Launch!

Now just run the following commands in order:

Copy

```
cd wiseflow
uv venv # Only needed the first time
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS# 
# Or on Windows:
# .venv\Scripts\activate
uv sync # Only needed the first time
python -m playwright install --with-deps chromium # Only needed the first time
chmod +x run.sh # Only needed the first time
./run.sh

```

The project will automatically launch a browser, guiding you through registration and into the user interface.
